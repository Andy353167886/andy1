<h3>personal information</h3>
<br>Name: Jin Guo
<br>Preferred in class: Andy
<br>Student id: S3949564
<br>Email: S3949564@student.rmit.com.au


<br>I was born and raised in tonga, an island located to the east side of Australia, close to New zealand.
Tonga is a beautiful island surrounded with white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforests.

<br><img src="Atata-Island.jpg" alt="tonga" style="width:900px;height:400px;">
<br>Although I was born in tonga, both my parents are chinese therefore I am from the nationality of China.The language that we speak at home is Mandarine no matter whether our family was in tonga or australia,
as thats a way to remember home and where the root of ours are.
Although we are away from our home, China, we keep in touch with family and friends at home by phone calls every month.
<br>I came to Australia at the age of 8 and studied grade 2, till now, studying information technology at rmit university.
I was interested in different things throughout different parts of my life for example, from the age of 10 basketball came into my interest.
I loved playing basketball because that was a way to get myself and my friends together.
I still love basketball to this day, I've played for several teams in my basketball career and won several awards including under 21s sabres champion and coaches awards.
<br>From the interest of basketball, it then led to me loving sneakers as my friends and I loved to look at sneakers and research them.
Then in grade 9 that was the first time I realised that there is a market for sneakers, then that became a hobby of mine to buy and resell hype sneakers.
Before covid, myself and my friends would line up outside of stores the day before a sneaker would release.
This is done upon hundreds of others who are wanting to buy the sneakers, so in some cases if we were less fortunate we would come out empty handed, and we would've wasted 24 hours or more sitting under the cold,
but for most of the time we are able to get our hands on the sneaker and we are able to flip them for hundreds of profits.
Now during the pandemic, social gatherings are restricted so most of the stores would release sneakers online via raffle or FCFS(first come first serve).
That's when I realised the importance of technology and this is when I slowly started to learn about technology and the terms for example ip addresses and more.

<h3>Interest In IT</h3>

IT came into my interest when I was addicted to video games in grade 6 and wanted to dig deep into the nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer coding and game development. But as I grew older I realised the potential of IT and the effect it has on generations of ours and future generations and that I could take advantage of it in favour of my future business. My plan in the future is to open my own business. I have an addiction in sneaker collecting and reselling, so I might take this into consideration for my future business. I'm thinking of the potential idea of making a virtual sneaker reselling platform, where customers can use the technology of VR to virtually try on the shoes that they are looking to buy. My first time interacting with IT and sneakers was in 2020, that was when the pandemic hit Australia that forced sneaker retailers to have no choice but to release sneakers online. Retailers switched their release procedures to online raffles or FCFS (first come first served). It was in an instance where I would get my parent account to enter in a same raffle, which led to all of us being banned from the site, and I never won anything for a couple of weeks. And it was not until a good friend of mine, Roy, taught me about ip addresses where retailers are able to track my entries and know that it was this one person putting in all the entries. After fixing up this mistake, after a week I was able to hit on these raffles again and regress into reselling my sneakers. Then I became more fascinated about the world of it as the way he taught me was super interesting. And I've spent days researching the gist of technology. From then on, I had the dream to make sneaker reselling a career and what else can I do to maximise the potential of the success of my businesses? Is to incorporate two of the most trending components of the economy into one.
I chose to study at RMIT because of their worldwide ranking Computer Science & Information Systems of 98th globally (Top 100) for Best Global World University Rankings 2021. Furthermore, it was super convenient for me to attend the campuses as I can move to the cbd, and that's a few minutes walk to campus. What I expect during my studies is to learn the fundamentals and hopefully to mastering or to understand more than the basics of
of coding and website development, also a bit of VR if we get a chance and to.

<br>The position above is a web developer, responsible for development of online retail store websites. The most appealing thing to me in this business is their wages and advertised casual and friendly working environment and most importantly a flat hierarchy, where they have an organisational structure with few or no levels of middle management between staff and executives, as I don't like to be bossed around. And this can avoid problem of higher executive’s discriminatory treatments of the lower classes in the organisation. Furthermore, I can learn more about website development as I work, which can build great experience for my future business. The skills that I would need for this position is to be reliable, team-oriented, self-motivated, have excellent time management skills, and demonstrate strong attention to detail. The skills that I have from this list is that I am reliable,I always do what I say and always keep my promises, for team assignments I will alway do my work and won't let the team down. Self oriented and motivated, and have great time management skills, I keep all schedules and dates in my calendar to prevent myself from forgetting.
Experience with all of the following technologies is a requirement: JavaScript, NodeJS,
SQL databases,TML, CSS, git version control software. I haven't got any experience from any of the above softwares, but I'm currently learning SQL data and Github website development. I will learn more and more and gain experience for SQL data and Github website development through the course of my study at RMIT.

<h3>Personality, Learning and Creative Test</h3>
<h4>Personality Test</h4>
<img src="Myerbriggs Personality test .png" alt="myer briggs test" style="width:1500px;height:600px;">
<br>Strength:
<br>Receptive – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.
<br>Reliable – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.
<br>Passionate – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.
<br>Altruistic – These personalities are known for harbouring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.
<br>Charismatic – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.

<br>
<br>Weakness:
<br>Unrealistic – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.
<br>Overly Idealistic – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.
<br>Condescending – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronising – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.
<br>Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.
<br>Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.

<h4>Online Learning Test</h4>
<br>Your Scores:Auditory: 15%/Visual: 45%/Tactile: 40%
<br>
<br>You are a Visual learning
<br>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
<br>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualise or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

<br>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
<br>-Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
<br>-Use flashcards to learn new words.
<br>-Try to visualise things that you hear or things that are read to you.
<br>-Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
<br>-Colour code things.
<br>-Avoid distractions during study times.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Creative Test</h4>
<img src="creative test .png" alt="creative test" style="width:1500px;height:600px;">
<br>What do the results of these tests mean for you?
<br>I'm a visual learner, I learn best by reading and seeing pictures, and most importantly
by the demonstration of others.
Although I have strong opinions, I am not closed minded and are willing to listen to others' options fully,
this ensures the positive environment of the team,
and that everyone has the right to speak their options even though I know that their points are not
correct.
I’m reliable, even though it’s hard to see, but I will keep my promises and complete the responsibilities
that are assigned to me.
But the weaknesses of my personality is that Most of the time I’m kind of forcing others to believe in my values, opinions, thoughts and ideas. I enjoy teaching, but at times, attempting to “enlighten” others may come across as patronising, which is not the most effective strategy for persuading other people.

<br>
<br>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
<br>With these attributes, I am a good team member but not a good team leader.
I am strong minded, which can affect my ability to listen to other members of my team.
But as a team member i can express those opinions to the leader and a person with a leadership
attributes can determine what is the right idea. I am a great team member as i will do the work and
Responsibilities that are assigned to, and that i'm passionate about what i'm doing so that the team
could ensure that my work is done to the best of my ability.

<br>
<br>How should you take this into account when forming a team?
<br>Can assign us responsibilities and share the workload. We also need some that are somewhat familiar
With information technology, as this is only my second year studying computer technology with the
first year being in highschool which wasn't as in-depth. This ensures that they can teach us and lead
Us through and project if we are stuck on a specific part. Furthermore, we wouldn't want more strong
Minded people as more than 2 of us can lead to serious conflicts in the team, which can decrease the
Productivity and the happiness of the team


<h3>IT Project</h3>
My IT project is to incorporate two of the hottest trends in the economy into one. Sneaker and computer technology,The birth of sneaker collecting, that led to the creation of sneakerhead cultures came in the United States in the 1980s, according to a 2020 Cowan research equity study, the U.S. sneaker resale market alone generated 2 billion dollars in 2019. IT trends are arising every year, it's something that humankinds cannot live without to this day, computing technology is seen everywhere, the smartphone we use, TV and computers etc. So why not incorporate them into one? So here is the introduction of my app, a virtual sneaker marketplace where consumers are allowed to try on the shoes they have been looking for through VR in the comfort of their couch.
The inspiration of the app came from my interest in both computer technology and sneakers. The rising trend in Information technology and the exploding trend in sneakers allows me to feel safe about my future and that my job wouldn't get eliminated. The U.S. sneaker resale market generated $2 billion in 2019, according to a 2020 Cowan Research Equity study, which also indicated that the sneaker resale business will explode and generate up to $30 billion by 2030. With the increased rhythm in life, not everyone has the time to go shopping, so the incorporation of VR allows the user to try on the shoes they are looking at from the comfort of their couch or at work.
This is a mobile app (available on the app store and google play store)where users are allowed to try on a pair of shoes that they have their eyes on, and unfortunately if that they don't have the spare time to shop in a brick and mortar store. Although we aren't the first people to think of this idea, courtesy to GOAT, they were the one of the first companies to think of this idea. But we are here to ameliorate this design, GOAT is limited to the amount of sneakers that you are able to try on to the hottest and trendiest sneakers that are very expensive, that not everyone is able to afford. Our app allows users to try on any shoes in the market from nike, new balance, adidas, etc. our app not only restricts the shoes that you can try on to the hottest and the most expensive but all the shoes in the market from nike, new balance, adidas including the less popular models. Imagine holding your phone down at your feet and a pair of dunk, air jordan or yeezys would appear on your feet. Our platform includes Buy sell and trade, which is, courtesy to stockx the largest sneaker market in the industry, where buyers are allowed to bid on their favourite shoes and sellers are allowed to to put their lowest ask into the platform, and when the prices of the buyer and seller are not to much apart then the seller is able to sell for the price of the bid, or if the buyer would buy at the lowest ask price. Our platform would operate in this same way but we are adding in a trading function, this is for the instance where sellers wanting to trade their shoes instead of selling their already owned sneakers into the platform and buying what they want again, this not only saves time and the effort, but also saves the money as they don't need to pay for the fees that they sold the sneakers and when they are buying the sneakers through the platform. We are taking two of the most dominating platforms in the sneaker industry, and taking the aspects that are most appealing to them, for example, the VR used by GOAT and the buying and lowest ask function used by stockx. To prevent buyers and traders being scammed on our platform we will have an online legit checking team , where they will review the pictures of the shoes that you are selling to the buyer or the shoes that you will be trading to the opposition. So essentially we are creating an online brick and mortar store where the prices of the sneakers are dictated by the seller and owners. This avoids any conflict between our customer service team and the buyer about the prices of the sneakers.
<br>
<br>The resources that we would need to start this project are mid tier Computer, sketchfeb 3D modelling inorder to scan the shoes into my platform, the actual shoes itself so that we either can scan the shoes into our program or we could search images of the sneaker online,and and use that as a template to create the actual shoes into our program , and labour resources, due to the heavy workload, we would work as a team to work on different parts of the app, for example, a person could work on the website it self, and other would work on the interface of the website, the security, and a few team members could work on the 3D modelling Vr of the actual shoes.
The skills that are required in this project is web development skills where i will need to javascript my own program, i will have to be able to create a app interface that are usable for the users, which is a skill that I am currently learning at RMIT university, Database management, a skill where i will know how to manage databases and secure information that ensures the safety of consumers private data. Finally, 3D modelling skills where i can create objects online that, to the users it feels like the object is obtainable and 3D.
<br>
<br>If my project is successful, the outcome would be a fully functioning app that allows the users to buy, sell and trade sneakers within the platform. Furthermore, the finished application would allow users to use the built in VR system to try on the shoes that they have been looking for, this should be fully functional and that flaws are fully minimised. Finally, the original problems of the two biggest companies in the industry would be solved. Stockx not having the VR function and GOAT not having a trading system. The emerge of these two platform could mean that in the future, due to the busy and fast paced lives of human, we are allowed to collect and buy what we love in the matter of a few clicks, and if we are unsure that a shoe fits our style, we are able to try it on using our VR system incorporated in the app.
